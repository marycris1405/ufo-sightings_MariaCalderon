# UFO Sightings Maria Calderon

## Description

The webpage and dynamic table Dana has built are working as intended, but Dana has decided she would like the table to be filtered even further. While it currently filters by the date, she would like to include the ability to filter by more column headers. The ability to pinpoint a search by date and country, for example, would go a long way in providing more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings.

## Objectives
The goals of this challenge are for you to:

* Create, update, and deploy JavaScript functions to provide additional table filters.
* Update and deploy forEach (for loop) to loop through the filters and update them with user input.
* Update and populate the dynamic filters and table using JavaScript and HTML.
